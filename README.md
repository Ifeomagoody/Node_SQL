# CRUD Operations using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

This project demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. It provides a simple API to manage a collection of items.



## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).


- MySQL: You need a running XAMMP server. You can install it locally or use a cloud-based service.



## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Node_MySQL.git


cd your-crud-app


2. Install dependencies:

npm install


3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide your MySQL connection string:


MySQL_URI=your_mysql_connection_string


4. Start the server:

npm start


The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.



## API Endpoints

- **GET /items**: Retrieve a list of all items.


- **GET /items/:id**: Retrieve a single item by ID.


- **POST /items**: Create a new item.


- **PUT /items/:id**: Update an existing item by ID.


- **DELETE /items/:id**: Delete an item by ID.

## Usage

You can use tools like cURL, Postman, or any API client to interact with the endpoints(in my case I used POSTMAN).

### Examples

1. **GET /items**

Retrieve a list of all items.

```shell
curl http://localhost:5000/items



GET /items/:id

Retrieve a single item by ID.




curl http://localhost:5000/items/your_item_id



POST /items

Create a new item.



curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "New Item"}' http://localhost:5000/items



PUT /items/:id

Update an existing item by ID.



curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Updated Item"}' http://localhost:5000/items/your_item_id


DELETE /items/:id

Delete an item by ID.


curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/items/your_item_id

Replace placeholders like `yourusername`, `your-crud-app`, and others with appropriate values for your project. Additionally, you need to implement the 


actual CRUD operations in your Node.js application using Express and MySQL.
